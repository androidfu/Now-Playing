### What is this repository for? ###

* Now Playing is also to demonstrate Bill's coding style and ability.

### How good is this code? ###

Well, that's really up to you to decide ;)  One of the reasons I put this application into open source was to encourage comment, scrutiny and debate.  I can tell you that _findbugs_ only reports 1 warning and I've refused to remove it because 1) it's not a _bad_ bug and 2) I like it the way it is ;)

### How do I use this code? ###

1. Clone it
